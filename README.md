# Introduction

In the era of distributed computing, micro-servers play a pivotal role in achieving scalable and efficient systems. This project explores and compares five distinct architectures for assembling micro-server environments, focusing on their performance under compute and networking constraints.

The study evaluates these architectures across five test cases and five key metrics, aiming to meet critical system requirements: low latency, high throughput, and high resource utilization. By leveraging advanced programming techniques such as object-oriented programming, interfaces, and multi-threading, and utilizing Python libraries like Simpy, NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas, the project delivers a comprehensive simulation framework.

The results, stored in the results directory, reveal the advantages of advanced models over baseline comparisons, providing valuable insights for optimizing distributed systems.
